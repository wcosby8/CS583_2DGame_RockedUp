## Changes from Original Design Document
The final version of Rocked Up was simplified from the original concept to ensure a polished minimum viable product. Originally, the game featured a 3-minute survival 
sequence followed by a boss fight with a rock golem, multiple attack types, weapon progression (punch, rock throw, and glock), and health pickups. The final implementation 
focuses on a single 90-second survival round with continuous falling rocks and ground-based ‚Äúrock goomba‚Äù enemies that can be stomped to destroy. Combat weapons and the boss 
fight were removed to reduce scope and prioritize core gameplay polish‚Äîmovement, jumping, collision detection, health tracking, sound feedback, and game state transitions 
(pause, win, lose).
